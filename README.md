The purpose of this project is to conduct comprehensive Air Quality Index (AQI) analysis, focusing on Delhi's air quality in January 2023. By gathering and processing data from various sources, including government monitoring stations and sensors, the project aims to calculate AQI values using standardized formulas. Visualizations such as line charts and heatmaps will be created to depict AQI trends over time and geographical regions. By comparing these metrics with recommended air quality standards, the project seeks to provide insights crucial for public health and environmental management initiatives. Overall, the project aims to offer a clear understanding of Delhi's air quality dynamics and its implications on the environment and public well-being.
